          <p class="description">IMDB uses the original title of a movie/show in its original language as it appears on screen in the opening credits. For TV titles this is the broadcast year of the first episode. For movie titles this year is either the year of general release or of a festival presentation if earlier (note that closed screenings for the crew or the media or test screenings of the unfinished product for marketing reasons do not count as public screenings). Please note that there are occasional exceptions to this rule. If there is a long gap between the completion of a film and its first public release it can be more representative to list the year the film was completed so as to more accurately reflect the title on the associated cast and crew name pages. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

            IMDb registered users can cast a vote (from 1 to 10) on every released title in the database. Individual votes are then aggregated and summarized as a single IMDb rating, visible on the title's main page.
            Individual ratings cast by IMDb registered users and use them to calculate a single rating. The arithmetic mean (i.e. the sum of all votes divided by the number of votes) is not used, although the mean and average votes are on the votes breakdown page; instead the rating displayed on a title's page is a weighted average.
            The IMDb weighted average does not change upon receipt of each new vote, but instead is updated numerous times per day.<sup>1</sup>

          <hr class="horizontal">
          <p class="description">
            The IMDb running times section records the duration in minutes of titles in the database. For theatrical releases the timing begins from the first distributor logo and ends at the last frame of the end credits. If there are any mid or post credits scenes, these should also be included in the running time. For TV-series it is preferred to include the time without commercials, but such timings are not always easily available so total running times may be submitted instead as long as the attribute (including commercials) is used.
            IMDB prefers to list one single running time for all titles which corresponds the default running time. This is the running time of the original release version in the country of origin and is indicated by an entry with a blank country field. However the running time of an entire series can be added once the series has completed, the complete running time should be submitted with the attribute (entire series).
            The primary running time for series should be the duration of one episode, not the whole series. As stated above, the complete running time can be added once the series has completed. A blank running time indicates the series is ongoing and the running time has not yet been calculated.
